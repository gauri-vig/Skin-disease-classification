# Skin-disease-classification 

This repository contains a deep learning–based CNN model designed for accurate classification of multiple skin diseases, using the Multiple Skin Disease Detection and Classification dataset from Kaggle. The model provides fast, reliable predictions and is optimized for deployment on low-resource devices, supporting sustainable and accessible healthcare technology.

🧩 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Skin diseases are among the most common health issues worldwide, yet early detection in rural and low-resource areas is often limited due to lack of dermatologists and diagnostic tools. Misdiagnosis or delayed treatment can lead to complications and increased healthcare costs.
This project addresses the problem by developing a lightweight, high-accuracy CNN model capable of classifying multiple skin diseases from images. The model is designed to run efficiently on low-resource devices, enabling early detection and assisting health workers in providing timely care, even in areas with limited access to medical expertise.

Goal: Enable accessible, scalable, and sustainable skin disease diagnosis using AI-driven image classification.

- Designing the initial CNN model structure for classification.
- Healthcare Accessibility Gap
- AI-Powered Solution

**🎯 Main Project: CNN-Based Skin Disease Detection**

✅ Objective

Build a high-accuracy, lightweight CNN model that can classify common skin diseases from images with minimal computational cost—ideal for low-resource or rural environments.

✅ Dataset

This dataset contains thousands of images covering multiple skin disease categories, including conditions like acne, eczema, psoriasis, and other dermatological disorders.

  Features:

  - High-resolution images of affected skin regions

  - Multiple disease categories for multi-class classification

  - Suitable for training deep learning models with transfer learning or fine-tuning
